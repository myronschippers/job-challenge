# Palindrome

A palindrome is a string that is the same when read forward and backwards. Write a function that takes in a string and returns a boolean indicating if the string is a palindrome.

**Clarifications (only if asked):**

JavaScript has a `.reverse()` method do not use for this problem Can assume input will be a string, but may include numbers

**Example test cases:**

- cat -> false
- tacocat -> true
- anna -> true
- blue -> false
