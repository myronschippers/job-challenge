# Two Numbers from Array Sum

Write a function that will take in two parameters - an array of numbers (the array) and a number (the sum). Your function should return true if two of the numbers in the array can add up to the sum.

**Example clarifying questions:**

- Will it always be an array of integers? Yes.
- Will the array of numbers be in order? Yes, from smallest to largest.

**Example test cases:**

```
sumChecker([1,2,3,4,8], 6) -> true
sumChecker([1,2,3,4,7], 9) -> true
sumChecker([1,2,3,7], 6) -> false
```
